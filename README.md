This is a smart contract for a voting system that uses a custom token. The token is created in the constructor with a name, symbol, and decimal value, and it can be bought by users by sending Ether to the contract. The contract also allows for the addition of three candidates, and users can vote for those candidates by spending a certain amount of tokens.

The token's total supply is stored in the totalSupply variable, and the balance of each user is stored in the balanceOf mapping. The allowance mapping is used to keep track of how much of a user's tokens can be spent by another address.

The buyTokens function allows users to buy tokens by sending Ether to the contract. The amount of Ether sent must be greater than or equal to the number of tokens being bought multiplied by the token price.

The addCandidate function is used to add three candidates to the system. The function checks that the three addresses provided are not the same.

The buyToken function is used by the contract owner to give a user 100 tokens. The function checks that the user is not the zero address and that the amount being sent is exactly 100.

The checkBalance function is used to check the balance of a user.

The vote function allows users to vote for three candidates by spending a certain amount of tokens. The function subtracts the token cost from the user's balance and adds points to each candidate based on the number of tokens spent.

The checkVote function is used to check the number of points a candidate has received.
